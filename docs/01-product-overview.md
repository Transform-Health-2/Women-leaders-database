# Transform Health Women Leaders Directory — Product Overview

## Mission

To increase visibility, representation, and engagement of women leaders across leadership, policy, and technical spaces in **digital health**.

We do this by building and maintaining a searchable, global directory of accomplished women working to transform health through technology, data, and innovation.

---

## The Problem We Solve

**Visibility Gap:** Women leaders in digital health are often invisible to:
- Organizations seeking expert advisors and board members
- Media and thought leaders looking for sources and speakers
- Early-stage professionals seeking role models and mentors
- Researchers building diverse teams and networks
- Policy makers designing inclusive initiatives

**Result:** Missed opportunities for collaboration, leadership visibility, and institutional diversity.
