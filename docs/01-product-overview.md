# Transform Health Women Leaders Directory — Product Overview

## Mission

To increase visibility, representation, and engagement of women leaders across leadership, policy, and technical spaces in **digital health**.

We do this by building and maintaining a searchable, global directory of accomplished women working to transform health through technology, data, and innovation.

---

## The Problem We Solve

**Visibility Gap:** Women leaders in digital health are often invisible to:
- Organizations seeking expert advisors and board members
- Media and thought leaders looking for sources and speakers
- Early-stage professionals seeking role models and mentors
- Researchers building diverse teams and networks
- Policy makers designing inclusive initiatives

**Result:** Missed opportunities for collaboration, leadership visibility, and institutional diversity.

3. **Manage Your Profile** — Update your information or remove yourself anytime via a secure magic link sent to your email. No account, no password, no admin intervention needed.

### Near-term Enhancements

#### Google Analytics 4 (GA4) — Visitor Insights

**Status:** Ready to implement — awaiting client Measurement ID  
**Effort:** Small (under 1 hour)  
**Requires:** Transform Health creates a GA4 property in their Google Analytics account

**What it adds:**

| Metric | Detail |
| --- | --- |
| Visitor counts | Daily/weekly/monthly unique visitors and sessions |
| Traffic sources | Where visitors come from (Google search, social, direct, referrals) |
| Country breakdown | Which countries visitors are in |
| Tab usage | Which sections (Directory, Analytics, Submit) are visited most |
| Device types | Desktop vs mobile vs tablet split |
| LinkedIn click events | Already tracked in the database; can be mirrored to GA4 as custom events |

**Implementation steps (for the development team):**

1. Client creates a GA4 property: Google Analytics → Admin → Create Property → copy the Measurement ID (`G-XXXXXXXXXX`)
2. Add two script tags to `client/index.html` (the gtag.js loader and config call)
3. Add a `hashchange` listener in `App.jsx` to fire `page_view` events when the user switches tabs — without this, only the initial page load is counted
4. Deploy — data appears in GA4 within 24–48 hours

**Privacy note:** GA4 Measurement IDs are public by design and safe to include in the HTML source. If Transform Health has users in the EU, a cookie consent notice may be required under GDPR. For a global audience with no EU-specific targeting, analytics-only mode without advertising features is generally considered low-risk — but Transform Health should confirm this with their legal or privacy advisor.

**Alternative:** [Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io) is a privacy-first, cookieless alternative that requires no consent banner anywhere in the world. It costs ~$9/month but is significantly simpler to comply with.
