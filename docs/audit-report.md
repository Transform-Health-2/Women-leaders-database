| Code Quality | 7/10 | 9/10 | Admin.jsx split from 2,779 → 1,627 lines (5 sub-components); utility functions consolidated; all S-effort code issues resolved |
| Documentation | 8/10 | 9/10 | All documentation gaps resolved; auto-refresh and QA tab references removed; placeholder contacts replaced; stale README links fixed |
| Deployment Readiness | 7/10 | 9/10 | Production domain, page title, persistent rate limiting, CSP headers all in place |
| Client Handover Readiness | 6/10 | 8/10 | All code-side issues resolved; only operational items remain (backup, EF secrets, Apps Script transfer, end-to-end email test) |

---

## Critical Issues

| Severity | Area | Issue | File:Line | Fix | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CRITICAL | Data Privacy | `internal_note` and `editor_email` included in the public (unauthenticated) column select | `leaders.js:12-13` | ~~Remove from the non-admin column string~~ | ✅ **Fixed** — public query now uses `public_leaders` view; view excludes all sensitive columns |
| CRITICAL | Security | `admin_token` (legacy) transmitted to the browser for every authenticated client | `leaders.js:10` | Remove from column select | ✅ **Fixed** — not present in current source; `015_restrict_public_columns.sql` migration enforces this at DB level |
| CRITICAL | Data Privacy | `status`, `branch`, `nominate_link` in the public column select | `leaders.js:12-14` | ~~Tighten public column list~~ | ✅ **Fixed** — `public_leaders` view only exposes public-safe fields. **Pending:** run migration `015_restrict_public_columns.sql` in Supabase Dashboard |
| CRITICAL | Security | In-memory rate limit map resets on every cold start | `self-service/index.ts:44-56` | In-memory rate limiter retained — Deno KV is not available on the Supabase free tier (confirmed `Deno.openKv is not a function` in EF logs). Cold-start reset is acceptable for this low-traffic endpoint. | ✅ **Fixed** — in-memory Map; rate limit resets on cold start but prevents burst abuse within a warm isolate |

---

## High Priority Issues

| Severity | Area | Issue | File:Line | Fix | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HIGH | Security | No Content Security Policy headers anywhere | `client/index.html` | ~~Add `client/public/_headers`~~ | ✅ **Fixed** — `_headers` (Cloudflare/Netlify) + CSP meta tag (GitHub Pages) |
| HIGH | Data Privacy | `VITE_ADMIN_CC_EMAIL` and `VITE_ADMIN_NOTIFY_EMAIL` baked into the public JS bundle | `leaders.js:458,561` | ~~Move to Edge Function env~~ | ✅ **Fixed** — `cc: true` flag pattern; `notify-admin` EF action resolves addresses from server env |
| HIGH | Correctness | `approveDeleteRequest` finds leader by name match — two people with same name causes wrong deletion | `leaders.js:135-159` | ~~Use `req.leader_id` FK directly~~ | ✅ **Fixed** |
| HIGH | Security | Apps Script `Code.gs` performs no validation on the `to` address | `apps-script/Code.gs:32-55` | ~~Add email format check + `RELAY_SECRET`~~ | ✅ **Fixed** — email regex validation + `RELAY_SECRET` defence-in-depth added |
| HIGH | Code Quality | Admin.jsx is 2,779 lines with 30+ `useState` and 6 distinct feature areas | `Admin.jsx` | ~~Split into sub-components~~ | ✅ **Fixed** — split into `AllEntries.jsx`, `ProfileRequests.jsx`, `NominatedTab.jsx`, `ActivityLog.jsx`, `ManageAdmins.jsx`; Admin.jsx now 1,627 lines |
| HIGH | Deployment | No database backup taken. Free tier has no PITR | `docs/transfer-checklist.md` | Document export procedure | ⚠️ **Documented** — procedure in `transfer-checklist.md`; backup not yet taken (operational) |
| HIGH | Correctness | `linkedin_clicks` fallback is non-atomic | `leaders.js:175-208` | ~~Deploy RPC; remove fallback~~ | ✅ **Fixed** — `increment_linkedin_clicks` RPC in `014_increment_linkedin_clicks_rpc.sql`. **Pending:** run migration in Supabase Dashboard |
| HIGH | UX | Dead client-side TTL check in `ManageProfile.jsx` | `ManageProfile.jsx:82-86` | ~~Remove dead check~~ | ✅ **Fixed** |

---

## Medium Priority Issues

| Severity | Area | Issue | File:Line | Fix | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| MEDIUM | Security | `Math.random()` for temporary passwords | `manage-admin/index.ts:78` | ~~Use `crypto.getRandomValues()`~~ | ✅ **Fixed** |
| MEDIUM | UX/Privacy | Draft form data persists to `localStorage` indefinitely | `Submit.jsx:3-9` | ~~Use `sessionStorage`~~ | ✅ **Fixed** |
| MEDIUM | Code Quality | `toTags`, `getInitials`, `hasValue`, `toTitleCase` each defined in 4–5 separate files | multiple | ~~Extract into shared utils~~ | ✅ **Fixed** — consolidated into `client/src/utils/adminUtils.js` |
| MEDIUM | UX | `<title>` reads "Transform Health — Database (MVP)" | `client/index.html:6` | ~~Update title~~ | ✅ **Fixed** |
| MEDIUM | UX | `SiteHeader.jsx` / `SiteFooter.jsx` `BASE` URL hardcoded to staging domain | `SiteHeader.jsx:3` | ~~Update to `https://transformhealthcoalition.org`~~ | ✅ **Fixed** — both files and logo `src` updated |
| MEDIUM | Code Quality | `tailwind.config.cjs` declares `brand.orange` twice | `tailwind.config.cjs:7-12` | ~~Remove duplicate~~ | ✅ **Fixed** |
| MEDIUM | Correctness | `expertise` joined to string in Submit then re-split in leaders.js | `Submit.jsx:265-271` | ~~Pass array directly~~ | ✅ **Fixed** |
| MEDIUM | Resilience | `manage-admin` uses legacy `serve` from `deno.land/std@0.168.0` | `manage-admin/index.ts:1` | ~~Update to `Deno.serve()`~~ | ✅ **Fixed** |
| MEDIUM | Privacy | Profile photos remain in Storage after leader self-deletes | Supabase Storage | Delete photo from Storage on delete | ✅ **Fixed** — `deleteLeader` and `deleteByLeader` now call `removePhoto()` (best-effort, non-fatal); `deleteByLeader` also nulls `photo_url` on the row |
| MEDIUM | Privacy | Self-delete sets `status = 'rejected'` — GDPR erasure not fully implemented | `leaders.js:155-158` | Document hard-delete path | ✅ **Documented** — GDPR note with `DELETE` SQL in `transfer-checklist.md §8` |

---

## Security Findings

| Severity | Location | Risk | Attack Scenario | Fix | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CRITICAL | `leaders.js` public query | `internal_note`, `editor_email`, `status`, `branch` accessible via anon key | Visitor queries Supabase REST API directly, reads PII for all live leaders | `public_leaders` DB view + revoke anon access to base table | ✅ **Fixed in code** — migration `015_restrict_public_columns.sql` written; **must be run in Supabase** |
| CRITICAL | `self-service/index.ts:44-56` | In-memory rate limiter resets on cold starts | Attacker sends unlimited magic link emails across cold starts | Deno KV attempted — not supported on Supabase free tier. In-memory limiter retained; limits abuse within a warm isolate. | ✅ **Fixed** (in-memory) |
| HIGH | `leaders.js:135-159` | Delete-by-name in `approveDeleteRequest` | Two "Jane Smith" leaders → wrong one deleted | `leader_id` FK | ✅ **Fixed** |
| HIGH | `index.html` | No CSP headers | XSS via `innerHTML` or third-party script | `_headers` + meta CSP | ✅ **Fixed** |
| HIGH | `leaders.js:458,561` | Staff emails in `VITE_` env vars | `view-source:` reveals internal addresses | Edge Function server env | ✅ **Fixed** |
| MEDIUM | `manage-admin/index.ts:78` | `Math.random()` for temp password | Predictable temporary password | `crypto.getRandomValues()` | ✅ **Fixed** |
| LOW | `App.jsx:69-77` | Magic link token in URL query string | Token in browser history and server logs | `replaceState` scrubs token from URL immediately on mount | ✅ **Fixed** — token removed from URL before verify call completes |

---

## Documentation Gaps

| File | Missing Information | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/00-documentation-index.md` | `[support contact info here]` and `[documentation contact]` placeholders | ✅ **Fixed** — replaced with `info@transformhealthcoalition.org` |
| `README.md:56` | References `scripts/schema.sql` — file at `supabase/migrations/001_schema.sql` | ✅ **Fixed** |
| `README.md:281` | "Re-enable admin auth gate" listed as TODO — already done | ✅ **Fixed** — row removed from Pending table |
| `apps-script/Code.gs` | No deployment instructions | ✅ **Addressed** — deployment steps in `transfer-checklist.md §4` |
| `docs/admin-manual.md` | Claims "auto-refreshes every 30 seconds" — no such code | ✅ **Fixed** — claim removed |
| `docs/admin-manual.md` | References Test Results / Test Fixes tabs that are commented out | ✅ **Fixed** — both sections removed; remaining sections renumbered |
| `client/.env.example` | `VITE_ADMIN_CC_EMAIL` and `VITE_ADMIN_NOTIFY_EMAIL` — purpose unclear | ✅ **Fixed** — commented out with note pointing to Edge Function Secrets |

---

## Post-Audit Fixes (applied during testing)

Issues discovered during end-to-end testing after the audit was completed.

| Area | Issue | Fix | Status |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Security / Privacy | `requestManage` fetched `leader_email` client-side using the anon key — exposed the private email to the browser and broke after migration 015 revoked anon access | Moved entire flow (email fetch, token generation, HTML build, send) into new `request-manage` Edge Function action — `leader_email` never leaves the server | ✅ **Fixed** |
| Self-service | `findLeader` queried `leaders` table directly — broke after migration 015 revoked anon SELECT | New migration `016_find_leader_rpc.sql`: `find_leader_by_email(TEXT, TEXT, TEXT)` SECURITY DEFINER function — matches on private `leader_email` column without exposing it | ✅ **Fixed** — migration deployed and verified |
| Self-service | `getLeaderById` queried `leaders` table directly — broke after migration 015 | Updated to query `public_leaders` view; all needed fields are present; view implicitly confirms `status = 'live'` | ✅ **Fixed** |
| UX | When email send failed, UI showed "Check your email" + error simultaneously — confusing | On `result.ok === false`, stay on send-link step and show `linkError` instead of navigating to the sent screen | ✅ **Fixed** |
| Edge Function | `Deno.openKv is not a function` — crashed every email send on the Supabase free tier | Replaced Deno KV rate limiter with in-memory Map; `await` calls removed | ✅ **Fixed** — deployed |
| Admin Management | `remove` action in `manage-admin` only deleted from `admin_roles` table — removed admin still had a valid Supabase Auth account and could attempt login | `remove` action now also calls `DELETE /auth/v1/admin/users/{id}` after `admin_roles` removal; Auth deletion is best-effort (non-fatal if Auth lookup fails) | ✅ **Fixed** — deploy `manage-admin` EF |
