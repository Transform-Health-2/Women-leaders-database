# Transform Health Women Leaders Directory

A project to increase visibility, representation, and engagement of women leaders across leadership, policy, and technical spaces in digital health.

## Project Structure

- **`client/`** — React + Vite frontend application
- **`apps-script/`** — Google Apps Script backend for Google Sheets integration (deploy docs: [apps-script/README_DEPLOY.md](./apps-script/README_DEPLOY.md))
- **`.github/workflows/`** — GitHub Actions for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages

---

## Client App — Quick Start

### 1) Install dependencies

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

### 2) Configure environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Set `VITE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL` to your deployed Apps Script web app URL (see `apps-script/README_DEPLOY.md`).

The app works without this variable — it falls back to mock data for local development.

### 3) Firebase Setup (profile photos)

Profile photos are uploaded to Firebase Storage. Configure these in your `.env`:

```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

**Setup steps:**
1. Create a Firebase project at [firebase.google.com](https://firebase.google.com)
2. Register a web app and copy the config values
3. Enable Storage (start in test mode)
4. Add the values to `.env`

**Photo handling:**
- Images are compressed client-side (max 600px longest edge, ~80% JPEG quality)
- Typical file size stays under 200KB
- Stored in Firebase Storage under `/profile-photos/<timestamp>-<name>.jpg`

### 4) Local development

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5) Build for GitHub Pages

```bash
npm run build
```

The `dist/` folder is published to GitHub Pages via `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` on every push to `main`.
