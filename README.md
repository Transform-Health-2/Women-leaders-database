---

## Quick Setup Guide

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- Supabase account (free tier at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com))
- GitHub account (for hosting)

---

### Step 1: Clone & Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tich-Labs/transform-health-directory.git
cd transform-health-directory
cd client
npm install
```

---

### Step 2: Supabase Setup

1. **Create a new Supabase project** at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).

2. **Run the schema** to create the `leaders` and `requests` tables:
   - In the Supabase dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
   - Paste and run the contents of `scripts/schema.sql`

3. **Create the Storage bucket:**
   - Go to **Storage** in the Supabase dashboard
   - Create a bucket named `profile-photos`
   - Set it to **Public** (public read, authenticated write)

4. **Enable Row Level Security:**
   - RLS is already configured in `scripts/schema.sql`
   - Verify: anon key should return only `live` leaders

5. **Note your project credentials:**
   - Go to **Project Settings → API**
   - Copy the **Project URL** and **anon public key**

---

### Step 3: Frontend Environment

```bash
cd client
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `client/.env` and set:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-ref.supabase.co
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-public-key
VITE_ADMIN_CC_EMAIL=name@yourorg.org
VITE_ADMIN_NOTIFY_EMAIL=noreply@yourorg.org
```

---

### Step 4: Run Migration (if starting fresh)

If you have existing data to migrate from Google Sheets:

```bash
# From the project root
node scripts/migrate-to-supabase.mjs
```

This script reads the existing leader data and inserts it into Supabase. The production migration inserted 82 leaders successfully with RLS verified.

---

### Step 5: Local Development

```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`.

**Manual testing flow:**

1. Open the DATABASE tab — you should see leader cards loading from Supabase (~82 leaders)
2. Submit a test profile via the SUBMIT PROFILE tab
3. Go to ADMIN tab — sign in with your Supabase admin account
4. Approve the test submission — the profile should appear in DATABASE

---

### Step 6: Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. **Add GitHub Actions secrets:**
   - Go to your GitHub repo → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**
   - Add all four secrets:
     - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
     - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
     - `VITE_ADMIN_CC_EMAIL`
     - `VITE_ADMIN_NOTIFY_EMAIL`
   - Remove any old Apps Script or Firebase secrets if present

2. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to **Settings → Pages**
   - Source: **GitHub Actions**
   - The workflow in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` will auto-deploy on every push to `main`

3. **Push to main:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial setup"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Before Going Live (Checklist)

- [ ] Create `test_results` table in Supabase (run `scripts/create-test-results-table.sql`)
- [ ] Re-enable admin auth gate — one-line change in `client/src/pages/Admin.jsx` (currently bypassed for testing)
- [ ] Create admin user in Supabase Auth dashboard (email/password)
- [ ] Update GitHub Actions CI secrets: add `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` + `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, remove `VITE_APPS_SCRIPT_URL`
- [ ] Set up email system for magic-link profile management:

  The self-service magic link flow lets leaders update or delete their own profiles with no account or password:
  1. Leader clicks "Manage your profile" on the site
  2. Enters name and email → system finds their profile
  3. Chooses "Update profile" or "Remove profile"
  4. A magic link is sent directly to their email (no admin involved)
  5. Leader clicks the link → edits fields directly or confirms deletion
  6. Changes save directly to the database — no admin approval needed

  **What the client needs to provide:**

  **Option A: Google Workspace (Recommended — Free for Workspace users)**
  The client must:
  1. Go to their **Google Account → Security → 2-Step Verification → App Passwords**
  2. Generate a **16-character app password** for **"Mail"**
  3. Share the app password with you

  Then configure these secrets in **Supabase Dashboard → Settings → Functions → Secrets**:
  - `APPS_SCRIPT_URL`: Google Apps Script Web App URL (email relay)
  - `GOOGLE_SMTP_USER`: The Workspace email (e.g. `noreply@transformhealthcoalition.org`)
  - `GOOGLE_SMTP_PASS`: The 16-character app password

  The Edge Function is already deployed at `supabase/functions/send-email/`. It forwards email requests to a Google Apps Script Web App which handles SMTP delivery.

- [ ] Verify: Trigger a magic link from the site's "Manage your profile" flow and confirm the leader receives the email

## Admin Console

- Standalone admin route with a dedicated admin header/footer and no public site nav/footer.
- Pending review includes a searchable, filterable list of submissions with expandable detail panels.
- Requests and profile update/delete flows are surfaced in a dedicated Requests tab with inline action buttons.
- All entries view supports sort order, pagination, and status badges for live/pending/rejected.
- The sidebar includes a refresh action and a quick "View directory" link back to the public database.
- Summary metrics surface pending, live, and rejected counts at the top of the console.
- **Currently in test mode — no login required.** Supabase Auth is wired but bypassed. Will be re-enabled before launch.

---

## Email Delivery

Email sending uses a Supabase Edge Function (`supabase/functions/send-email/`) that proxies through a Google Apps Script Web App:

```
requestManage() → supabase.functions.invoke("send-email")
                  → Google Apps Script → Google Workspace SMTP
```

The `APPS_SCRIPT_URL`, `GOOGLE_SMTP_USER`, and `GOOGLE_SMTP_PASS` secrets are configured in the Supabase project dashboard. The `apps-script/` folder contains the legacy Apps Script code (retained for reference).

---

## Available Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start Vite dev server |
| `npm run build` | Build for production |
| `npm run preview` | Preview production build locally |
| `npm run format` | Format code with Prettier |
| `node test-dummy-test.js` | Insert a dummy test result into Supabase `test_results` table |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
| --- | --- |
| 0 leaders in DATABASE tab | Check `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in `client/.env` |
| Supabase returns empty array | Verify RLS is configured — anon key should return only `live` leaders |
| Photo not uploading | Check Supabase Storage bucket `profile-photos` exists and is public-read |
| Admin tab shows login screen | Auth gate has been re-enabled — create an admin user in Supabase Auth dashboard |
| CI/CD failing on GitHub Actions | Verify `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` are set in GitHub repo secrets |
| Migration script fails | Check `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` is set — migration requires the service role key, not the anon key |

## Testing

For interactive testing, open `testing-sheet.html` in your browser — it includes test cases across multiple sections with step-by-step instructions, priority indicators, and auto-saved results.

**Test results** are saved to the Supabase `test_results` table and visible in the **Admin Console → "Test Results" tab** (new tab with pass/fail/pending summary cards and full results table).
